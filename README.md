# A PRELIMINARY ATTEMPT AT PREDICTING FUTURE BITCOIN TRENDS

### WHY CHOOSING THIS PROJECT? The world of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular and I thought it would be interesting to work with the challenge of the unpredictable nature of crypto.

### WHAT APPROACH WAS USED? Predictions were made based on TimeSeries modelling of both financial data of BTC price and Sentiment Analysis of BTC Tweets.

### WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED? As this was an initial attempt at working with TimeSeries modelling, it would be useful to have a more powerful model to make these predictions and possibly support it with more data collected from Twitter.
